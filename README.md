  - Accounts for special attack resets that happen at Colosseum and Doom of Mokhaoitl

- Timer resets whenever spec energy actually increases, preventing drift between the overlay and actual game mechanics
  - accounts for surge pot / death charge same tick regen

- Fixed Surge Pot timer for ToB, Colosseum, and Doom of Mokhaoitl

- Performs identically to Regeneration Meter otherwise
